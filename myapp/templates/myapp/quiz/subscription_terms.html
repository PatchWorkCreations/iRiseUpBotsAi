    <h2>Changes</h2>
    <p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable laws, we may change subscription fees at any time. We will give you reasonable notice of any such pricing changes by posting the new prices on the Website and/or by sending you an email notification, or another prominent method. If you do not wish to pay the new fees, you can cancel the applicable subscription before the change takes effect.</p>
